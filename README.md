# Mutual Recursion in Final Encoding - Examples

Example codes to my [blog
post](http://aherrmann.github.io/programming/2016/05/28/mutual-recursion-in-final-encoding)
about defining mutually recursive functions within an embedded language that is
implemented through final encoding in Haskell.

There are no special dependencies. The code has been tested on GHC 7.6.3 and
7.10.3. To play around with the example codes simply load the corresponding
module within `src/` into `ghci`.
